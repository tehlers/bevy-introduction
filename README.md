# Bevy introduction

An introduction to the game engine [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org) made with [presenterm](https://mfontanini.github.io/presenterm/).
The core concepts of Bevy are explained using a series of examples that result in a simple breakout game at the end.

## Installation

You need to install the Rust toolchain to execute the examples.
Follow the instructions on [Rust's official setup page](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).
If you are using Linux, you should also check the [official Bevy Linux dependencies page](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/docs/linux_dependencies.md).

Once you have installed all dependencies, you can run the examples with

    cargo run --example EXAMPLE

[Presenterm](https://mfontanini.github.io/presenterm/) must be installed in order to display the presentation with

    presenterm --enable-snippet-execution --present bevy-introduction.md

The project contains a [Justfile](https://just.systems/) that provides frequently used commands.
